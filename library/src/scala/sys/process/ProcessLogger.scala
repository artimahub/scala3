 *  by [[scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilder]] when starting a process, as an
 *  alternative to [[scala.sys.process.ProcessIO]], which can be more difficult
 *  to use. Note that a `ProcessLogger` will be used to create a `ProcessIO`
 *  anyway. The object `BasicIO` has some functions to do that.
 *
 *  Here is an example that counts the number of lines in the normal and error
 *  output of a process:
 *  ```
 *  import scala.sys.process._
 *
 *  var normalLines = 0
 *  var errorLines = 0
 *  val countLogger = ProcessLogger(line => normalLines += 1,
 *                                 line => errorLines += 1)
 *  "find /etc" ! countLogger
 *  ```
